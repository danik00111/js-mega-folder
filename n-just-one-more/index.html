    You have a score, starting at, say, 100.<br>
    Flip a coin <u>(it is a perfect 50/50 coin)</u>,<br>
    if you get heads - your score is increased by 80%,<br>
    tails - decreased by 50%. Sounds good, right?<br>
    <br>
    Right?<br>
    <br>
    You can also force an outcome, to see what happens<br>
    after a certain amount of heads and tails.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The reason why you get below 1, unable to climb back up, SO MUCH, is simple:<br>
    <span id="spoiler">One head (*1.8) and one tail (*0.5) together give *0.9,<br>so, on average, your score decreases,<br>even though you "get more from 1 head than lose from 1 tail".</span>
  </p>
  <p id="disclaimer">* score is rounded to 4 decimal places</p>
